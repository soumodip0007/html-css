            <h2>Hi I am Wizard </h2>
            <p>Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which puts players in games featuring two or
               four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers,
               with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win. After three
               minutes, if both of the players/teams have an equal number of crowns or none at all
               the match continues into a 2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an
               opposing tower wins instantaneously. If no towers are destroyed during overtime, 
               there is a tiebreaker, where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the
               least health is destroyed. If two towers have the same health, there is a draw.In
               Clash Royale, players are ranked by their number of trophies. Players level up by 
               gaining Experience (or King Level) points through donating and upgrading cards. 
               The highest possible level is level 14.Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles.
                A player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower 
                being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in
                an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time
                by both players, resulting in a rare draw). There are fifteen playing arenas in total 
                (excluding the Training Camp tutorial area): Goblin Stadium, Bone Pit, Barbarian Bowl,
                P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, Spell Valley, Builder's Workshop, Royal Arena, Frozen Peak, 
                Jungle Arena, Hog Mountain, Electro Valley, Spooky Town, Rascal's Hideout, Serenity Peak,
                and The Legendary Arena. Each arena corresponds to a certain trophy range.The Legendary
                Arena consists of "Leagues," which were added to the game in March 2017. Once above 5000 
                trophies, players play through nine different leagues ranging from Challenger I to Ultimate 
                Champion. At the end of each season, the player is reset to half of the trophies they 
                gained above 5000 trophies.</p>
