        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example,
        to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns,
        or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning
        to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like,
         and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.

     <p class="second">
        This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the 
        language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper.
        This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, 
        sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more. The aim here is to provide you with a 
        toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to 
        more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.
     </p>
     <p class="third">
        With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text 
        — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including 
        setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round 
        off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
     </p>
     <p class="fourth final">
        At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate
        the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place 
        in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive 
        deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and 
        positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
